FEEDBACK:

Well done in implementing class Country toString() method to leverage 
	class SubscriptionYearâ€™s toString() method.



-0 Your output of for invalid data ranges is very hard to read.
   Why do you have multiple messages of "ERROR: Problem with the years input"?
   Reduce the error messages to only one per request for number of subscriptions.
   
   Next time minus for this.
   
   
-0.5 Why does your output differ for the same set of valid test ranges?
    See sample output below where you have 207.38 and 208.38.
    There is not data prior to 1990 for the row titled "UN classification" in the 
    full CSV file.
    Next time minus one for each invalid result.
    
    
-0 Missing documentation for your CSVReader class in Javadocs.
   I see that you commented your source code. 
   However the format is incorrect. Instead of:
	/*
	 * This method is a Constructor that takes in the country name and number of years. 
	 * @param country 				The name of the country 
	 * @param numberOfYears			The integer of the number of years 
	 */
	  
	public Country(String country, int numberOfYears) { ... }
	
	Use /** as the opening comments.
	  
    Did you forget to verify whether your index.html file in "doc" folder generated correctly? 
    Next time minus for this.

sample output:

Aruba (1960 to 2012): 1170.50 

Hungary (1960 to 2012): 1246.58 

Singapore (1960 to 2012): 1582.80
